# Battlefield 4 Soldier Page UI

This project demonstrates the development of the Battlefield 4 Soldier page UI using React.js, Tailwind CSS for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The UI includes hover and click interactions, and the data is fetched from the backend through API calls.

## Installation Guide

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2. Install the required Node.js packages:

    ```bash
